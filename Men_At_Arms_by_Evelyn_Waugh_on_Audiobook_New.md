Overview
&quot;An eminently readable comedy of modern war&quot; (New York Times), Men at Arms is the first novel in Evelyn Waugh&#039;s brilliant Sword of Honor trilogy.
 Guy Crouchback, determined to get into the war, takes a commission in the Royal Corps of Halberdiers. His spirits high, he sees all the trimmings but none of the action. And his first campaign, an abortive affair on the West African coastline, ends with an escapade that seriously blots his Halberdier copybook.
 Men at Arms is the first novel in Waugh&#039;s brilliant Sword of Honor trilogy recording the tumultuous wartime adventures of Guy Crouchback (&quot;the finest work of fiction in English to emerge from World War II&quot; --Atlantic Monthly), which also comprises Officers and Gentlemen and Unconditional Surrender.
