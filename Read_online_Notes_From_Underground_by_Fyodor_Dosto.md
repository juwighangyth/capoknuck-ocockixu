Generally referred to by reviewers as the Underground Man, the novella offers itself as a passage from the memoirs of a retired government worker residing in St. Petersburg, a bitter, solitary, anonymous narrator. Though the initial section of the novella has the shape of a monologue, the narrator&amp;#039;s approach to addressing his reader is somewhat dialogized. Mikhail Bakhtin said in the Underground Man&amp;#039;s confession, &amp;quot;There is not a single monologically strong, undissociated word.&amp;quot; Every word the Underground Man speaks reflects the words of someone with whom he is in an intense mental quarrel. The Underground Man attacks modern Russian philosophy, specifically Nikolay Chernyshevsky&amp;#039;s What Is to Be Done? In a broader sense, the book challenges and rebels against determinism, a theory that reduces everything, including human personality and will, to the laws of nature, science, and mathematics. The Underground Man&amp;#039;s narration is rife with ideological allusions and complex conversations about the political climate of the time. Using his fiction as a weapon of ideological discourse, Dostoevsky challenges the ideologies of his time, mainly nihilism and rational egoism. The novel rejects the rationalist assumptions that underlie Jeremy Bentham&amp;#039;s utilitarian social philosophy.
