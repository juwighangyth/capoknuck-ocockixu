ADVENTURER WANTED FOR OVERNIGHT HIKE After losing her job with the US Forestry Service, Celeste Foster makes a desperate gamble by answering an ad for a job in rural Virginia. What she doesn&amp;#039;t anticipate is sliding into an alternate version of the Appalachian mountains. Before Celeste understands what&amp;#039;s happening, she agrees to hike up a cursed mountain to save a town from complete annihilation. And in the days leading up to the ritual, she learns that gods and monsters live alongside humans in the Valley. Here, magic runs in every family, and she learns that her connection to the Valley runs deep. Armed with a bag of ritual items, a recording, and the hopes of the pretty barista who helped her, Celeste starts up Bloom Mountain. The ritual will test Celeste to her core, and push her autistic boundaries to their fullest. The Binding of Bloom Mountain is an adult cozy fantasy/folk horror book with mild horror sequences and a soft sapphic romance subplot. Content warnings available inside and on the authors website.
