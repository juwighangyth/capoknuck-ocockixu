Overview
Society insists that the life of an heiress ought to be consumed with dancing, polite conversation, and cards. The sadists! As Penelope Sedgewick would rather fly to Saturn&#039;s third moon than conform to society&#039;s whims, she became a sleuth, investigating private matters for ladies-thefts, missing domesticated dragons, stolen charms... the usual. Of course, it is all very hush-hush. Do try to keep it that way. When a routine inquiry into an elopement becomes derailed by a dead body (or two), and one dear to her is implicated, Penelope&#039;s skills will be put to the test. With so much on the line, it will take a combination of her intelligence, magical abilities (Shhh! These are also secret), and marksmanship to protect that which she holds dear while shielding the innocent. Talismans, Teacups, and Trysts is K. Starling&#039;s premier novel in the Alderwood Series: a series of cozy fantasies set in a reimagined regency world filled with dragons, magic, and intrigue.
