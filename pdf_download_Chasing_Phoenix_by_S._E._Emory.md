Overview
Leora
 All my life I have been invisible and I liked it that way. I had a plan. Get out of this small town. Never look back.
 But then Everett Rowan came crashing into my world and changed everything. Between secrets shared in notes and promises made between stolen kisses, he made me fall desperately and overwhelmingly in love with him. He burned my plans and my heart to ashes.
 He gave me his secret. I gave him everything.
 He promised to stay. And then he left me.
 Everett
 From the moment I was born, I carried expectations of who I was meant to be and who I was meant to be with. And as the mayor&#039;s son and All-American star quarterback, those expectations only grew heavier.
 But then she crashed into my life and shifted everything. She tilted my world upside down and made me question what it is I wanted out of life. She instilled in me a bravery I had never known. A bravery to defy expectation.
 I was relentless in my love for her. And I had finally caught my pretty bird.
 But then she left me. And I will chase her till my last breath.
