CLIMAX AFTER CLIMAX AFTER CLIMAX!
 
 Yoshitake, this worldâ€™s horniest man, saved a planet by losing his virginity to and having a child with Lune, the alien who came to Earth in order to prevent the extinction of her species! And thus ends our epic tale, but...what of the other members of Yoshitakeâ€™s harem?
 
 Thereâ€™s the orally fixated Haruka, who never went all the way despite being Yoshitakeâ€™s official girlfriend, and the delicate-but-pushy older sister and good drinking buddy Mika! Nor can we forget Levelane, Lune&amp;#039;s younger sister who treated Yoshitake as an enemy, or Rima, the big-boobed alien bimbo who raced to Earth to use her devilish body as a weapon. After Lune returns to her homeworld, what is left for Yoshitake? The answer to that question may just lead to a happy ending for them all!
 
 The final volume!
