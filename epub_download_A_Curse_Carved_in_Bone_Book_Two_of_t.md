Notes From Your Bookseller The Saga of the Unfated continues with another fiery, captivating romantasy where Freya fights for her kingdom â€” and her heart. A shield maiden fights to break the shackles of prophecyâ€”and to overcome the betrayal of the man who broke her heartâ€”in this searing conclusion to the Norse-inspired fantasy romance duology that began with the bestselling A Fate Inked in Blood.
 
 The stunning first edition hardcover will feature foil page edges, a custom-stamped case, and a premium dust jacket!
 
 The secret of her divine heritage revealed, Freya finds herself on a path that will see thousands of lives lost to the magic in her blood. Desperate to avoid this dark fate, she risks an alliance with Skalandâ€™s greatest enemy to seek answers from the seer who foretold her futureâ€”the same seer who sent Bjorn to kill her.Â 
 Â 
 While Freya still seethes with rage over Bjornâ€™s betrayal, the blood oaths that bind her demand that she keep him close as she hunts for a way to avert the looming war. Her magic draws her to the front lines of an old enmity, embroiling her with Nordelandâ€™s Unfatedâ€”children of the gods who serve the king she was raised to fear. The same king who, unlike Bjorn, is now willing to fight at her back. For despite the desire that burns hot between Bjorn and Freya, his growing distrust of her chosen path threatens to drag them further apart.
 Â 
 As war approaches, gods and mortals must choose their weapons. Yet the fiercest battle will be the one Freya wages within herself. With the magic of two goddesses burning in her veins, she must weave the threads of destiny to decide her own fate: Will she be the shield that protects her people or the curse that destroys them?
