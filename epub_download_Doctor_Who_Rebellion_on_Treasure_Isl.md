In a dark corner of the universe, on a distant and long forgotten planet, a young boy called Jim stumbles upon a warped, shifting treasure map, and a key. With nothing to lose, he leaves his dead planet behind him in search of long-forgotten treasure.
 
 Teaming up with the Doctor and Amy Pond, the team battle alien pirates, shipwrecks and skeletons. The key promises to unlock treasures buried deep in the sands of time. Treasures of planets and civilizations long fallen. But with time, and swords, pointedly against them, will the Doctor and his friends find what they need to unlock?
