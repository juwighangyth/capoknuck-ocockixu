Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller Pushcart Prize-winning author Kristopher Jansma&#039;s novel of a war-torn Netherlands introduces readers to a harrowing story of perseverance and the power of family. An elderly woman recounts her Dutch familyâ€™s survival during the final years of Nazi occupation, shedding new light on old secrets that rippled through subsequent generations.Â  Eighty-year-old Mieke Gebornâ€™s life is one of quiet routine. Widowed for many years, she enjoys the view from her home on the New Jersey shore, visits with friends, and tai chi at the local retirement community. But when her beloved grandson, Will, and his wife, Teru, show up for a visit, things are soon upended. Their marriage is threatening to unravel, and Will has questions for his grandmotherâ€”questions about family secrets that have been lost for decades and are now finally rising to the surface. But telling Will the truth involves returning to the past, and to Miekeâ€™s childhood in coastal Holland. There, in the last years of World War II, she survived the Hunger Winter, a brutal season when food and heat were cut off and thousands of Dutch citizens starved. Her memories weave together childhood magic and the madness of history, and carry readers from the windy beaches of the Hague to the dark cells of a concentration camp, through the bends of eel-filled rivers, and, finally, to the story of Willâ€™s father, absent since Willâ€™s childhood. Our Narrow Hiding Places is a sweeping story of survival and of the terrible cost of warâ€”and a reminder that sometimes the traumas we inherit come along with a resilience we never imagined.
