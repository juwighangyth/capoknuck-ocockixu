FromÂ Not Here to Be LikedÂ author Michelle Quach comes a smartly funny, heartfelt story told in dual POV about a young woman roping in her childhood crush to act as an honorary male heir to fulfill her grandfatherâ€™s dying wish. A story about first love, familial duties, and finding yourselfâ€”perfect for fans of Emiko Jean and Loan Le. Francine loves her grandfather, but their time together is running out. He has one final wish: to see a male heir carry on the family traditions. Francine knows his ideas are outdated, but she would do anything for him. Her solution? Ask Ollie Tran, a family friend (and former crush, not that it matters), to pretend to be ceremonially adopted and act like the grandson her A Gung never had. Ollie has always made a point of avoiding the odd, too blunt (and fine, sort of cute) Francine, whose intensity has always made him uncomfortable. So when she asks him to help deceive her dying A Gung, Ollieâ€™s definitely not down. He doesnâ€™t get why anyone would go to such lengths, even for family. Especially with a backwards (and sexist, Ollie keeps stressing) scheme like this. Francine, however, is determined to make it work, and soon Ollie finds himself more invested in her planâ€”and in herâ€”than he ever thought possible. But as the tangled lies and feelings pile up, Francine will have to discover what exactly she needs for herselfâ€”and from Ollie. Because sometimes the boy you always wanted isnâ€™t what you expected.
