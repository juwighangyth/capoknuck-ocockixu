Overview
A sharply written, action-packed chronicle of Denver Broncos championship history. For 16 seasons, John Elway was nothing less than the figurehead of a franchise and the heartbeat of a city. As a quarterback, he was a tenacious scrambler; given the choice of sliding safely a yard short of the first down marker or taking a hit if it meant moving the chains, he never failed to absorb the blow. As a leader he was the embodiment of quiet confidence, inspiringâ€” rather than demandingâ€” the best from his Denver Broncos teammates. The Elway Years is an essential portrait of this singular era for Denver sports, one which culminated in back-to-back championships but was built on years of failure and resilience. When Elway hung up his cleats after Super Bowl XXXIII, his status as one of football&#039;s all-time greats was assured. But for over a decade, despite the records, awards, and thrilling late-game comebacks, that legacy hung in the balance. Veteran reporter Mike Klis captures the essence of Elway&#039;s dogged pursuit of greatness, weaving together memory, research, and keen analysis. Through the words of teammates, executives, and Elway himself, readers are invited to delve into the captivating journey of this football icon, exploring the triumphs and trials that defined his remarkable career. From The Drive to the long-awaited hoisting of the Lombardi Trophy and the quieter moments in between, The Elway Years is a must-read for Broncos faithful and football fans everywhere.
