Whether a first-time visitor or a repeat traveler to the always mysterious and sometimes treacherous Glipwood Forest, this illustrated guide is an invaluable addition to any Wingfeather fanâ€™s knapsack.
 
 A Rangerâ€™s Guide to Glipwood Forest expands the legend and lore of this treacherous land of fatal flora and fanged beastsâ€”and the history of the first adventurers daring enough to brave the forest depths. Through detailed line art, maps, and directions, travelers can safely marvel at the majestic glipwood trees, poke around the (possibly haunted) Anklejelly Cavern,Â dip their toes into the Mighty River Blapp (if they dare!), and avoid falling off a cliff edge into the Dark Sea of Darkness and being swallowed by a sea dragon.Â 
 
 Both longtime Wingfeather fans and readers new to the series will be enthralled, tickled, delighted, and occasionally disturbed by never-before-known nuggets, familiar factoids, and all-new stories about the forest and the brave rangers who made passage into its dark depths possible.Â Donâ€™t attempt an exploration, journey, or meander through Glipwood without it!
