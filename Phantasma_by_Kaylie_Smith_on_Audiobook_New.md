Notes From Your Bookseller A deadly competition, a dangerous bargain and forced-proximity make this the paranormal romance of our dreams. AN INSTANT USA TODAYÂ BESTSELLER &amp;amp; BOOKTOK SENSATION
 
 Welcome to Phantasma. There are only two rules to the game: Stay alive. And donâ€™t fall in love.
 
 When Opheliaâ€™s sister disappears, there is only one way to save her. Ophelia must enter Phantasma, a deadly contest inside a haunted mansion, and claim its prizeâ€”a single wish.
 
 Phantasma is a maze of twisting corridors and lavish ballrooms, of demons and temptations. Ophelia will face nine challenges, each more dangerous than the last. There can only be one winner, and the other contestants will stop at nothing to eliminate their rivals.
 
 Every day the house creates new monsters. But just as Opheliaâ€™s fears threaten to overwhelm her,Â a mysterious stranger offers her a bargain.
 
 Charming, arrogant and infuriatingly attractive,Â BlackwellÂ claims he can guide her through the lethal trials ahead. All he asks in return is ten years of her life.
 
 Ophelia knows she shouldnâ€™t trust him. Blackwell doesnâ€™t seem dangerous, but appearances can be deceptive. Worse still, she feels a dark and irresistible attraction drawing them closer and closer.
 
 Her life is on the line.Â But in Phantasma, the only thing deadlier than losing the game is losing your heart . . .Â 
 
 A Court of Thorns and RosesÂ meetsÂ CaravalÂ in this seductive fantasy adventure. With steamy romance, a sexy morally gray love interest, OCD rep and jaw-dropping twists,Â PhantasmaÂ is perfect for fans of Rebecca Yarros, Nisha J. Tuli and Carissa Broadbent.
 
 The print edition includes custom gold foiling on the cover!
